# This code is an Azure function.
1. You need `Node.js`.
2. Setup Azure for VS Code to run locally: [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v3%2Cwindows%2Ccsharp%2Cportal%2Cbash#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
3. Create your function and use index.js and function.json as your function files.
  
Run the function with: 
```
func start
```

It will generate a link for you which will simulate the Azure function platform locally.
